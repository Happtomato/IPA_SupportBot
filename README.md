# IPA Support Chatbot

This project was developed as part of my final Individual Practical Assignment (IPA) to successfully complete my apprenticeship as a software developer. It serves as a demonstration of applied skills in full-stack development, cloud services, and AI integration.

The **IPA Support Chatbot** is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users find answers to product-related questions using a natural language interface. It integrates a modern Svelte-based frontend with a Python Flask backend and utilizes Microsoft Azure services such as OpenAI and AI Search for intelligent response generation.

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
The chatbot provides users with fast, AI-assisted answers to support-related questions, by combining:  
- User-friendly chat UI (via Svelte frontend)  
- Flask backend that connects to:  
  - Azure OpenAI for response generation  
  - Azure AI Search for knowledge retrieval  

**Use Case:**  
Originally designed for a supplier in the food logistics sector, this chatbot is tailored to search and answer from a structured product information base.
